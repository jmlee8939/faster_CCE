# Faster-CCE
by jaeminiman  
Conection center evolution(CCE) is proposed by Geng et al. in 2020. 
It is a clustering method producing multiple clustering results with diverse scale.
Faster CCE is an improved methodology, which can find clustering results much faster then CCE. 
We used enhanced-matrix in order to accelerate the center merging process in CCE.
And this idea was published in Pattern Recognition Journal
